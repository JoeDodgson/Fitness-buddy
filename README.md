## Description

Fitness Buddy is a fitness app that provides users with a guidance on how to perform exercises.

The user can create a profile by signing up and is able to find detailed information on exercises. Queries can be launched in the _Search Page_ by _Exercise Name_, _Muscle Group_ or _Equipment_. Any result in _Results Page_ can then be added to favourites. The user can thus have a list of personal selections that can be accessed any time on the _Favourite Exercises Page_. Any item in the personal list can be interrogated for more information on how the specific exercise can be performed, including picture and a full description.

Built on _Node.js_ environment, Fitness Buddy uses a _sql_ database, Wger API and is deployed on Heroku.

On the back end, the server is setup with `Node` and `Express`. `Passport` dependency is used for authentication and the app features an _ORM_ using `Sequelize`.

Fitness Buddy creates the front end via `Pugjs` template engine and deploys on Heroku.
